"Ugh.." I regain consciousness and survey my surroundings.
I notice my watch has been damaged.
Around me are some plains, and a forest off slightly in the distance. There is also a very clean looking river nearby.
I remember for a second that I need to get to the graduation ceremony, but realize that would probably be impossible now.
I stop suddenly. 
Something is nearby.
It jumps out of a bush and attacks me, but putting my training to use I fend off the googa. 
They come in many different types, but luckily this kind wasn't too dangerous.
My watch seems to react to the googa's death, but not very noticeably.
I loot a shard from its body knowing that is a very valuable resource. 
For the time being I need try and find out if there are any other people in the area. 
I didn't have to look long, as there was a group of people in the distance approaching rather quickly.
I start making my way over toward them.
"Stop there. Who are you?" they immediately interrogate me from a distance.
"I'm not looking for any trouble", I reply from a distance, noticing they won't let me get any closer for now.
"That shard, is it from a googa?" noticing what I was holding from my previous encounter I am questioned again.
"Yeah, I was attacked earlier by a small one." 
They all look a lot more concerned now.
"I hope this means we are on the same side, either way we don't have much time to cause conflict."
"If the googas have already made it this far we had better prepare for their next attack, we've been pursued the entire way here".
"Let's settle down and gather wood to build some defences before night strikes" he continues,
"This is when the googas are most likely to attack."
"We are settlers who come from the south, forced to move elsewhere to avoid conflict with the googas. If you really are on our side, then make yourself useful"
Now informed of the situation, I determine it would be best to help out the settlers fend off the googas.
